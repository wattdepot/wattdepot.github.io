**"Makahiki+WattDepot: An open source software stack for next generation energy research and education"**,
Philip M. Johnson, Yongwen Xu, Robert S. Brewer, Carleton A. Moore, George E. Lee, Andrea Connell. In
Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Sustainability (ICT4S), February 2013.

Abstract: Satisfying the radically different requirements and operating assumptions of the next generation smart grid requires new kinds of software that enable research and experimentation into the ways that electrical energy production and consumption can be collected, analyzed, visualized, and provided to consumers. Since 2009, we have been designing, implementing, and evaluating an open source software “stack” to facilitate this research. This software stack consists of two custom systems called WattDepot and Makahiki, along with the open source components they rely upon (Java, Restlet, Postgres, Python, Django, Memcache). In this paper, we detail the novel features of WattDepot and Makahiki, our experiences using them for research and education, and additional ways they can be used for next generation energy research and education.

**"WattDepot: An open source software ecosystem for enterprise-scale energy data collection, storage, analysis, and visualization"**, Robert S. Brewer, Philip M. Johnson. 
In Proceedings of the First International Conference on Smart Grid Communications, October, 2010.

Abstract: WattDepot is an open source, Internet-based, service-oriented framework for collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of energy data. WattDepot differs from other energy management solutions in one or more of the following ways: it is not tied to any specific metering technology; it provides high-level support for meter aggregation and data interpolation; it supports carbon intensity analysis; it is architecturally decoupled from the underlying storage technology; it supports both hosted and local energy services; it can provide near-real time data collection and feedback; and the software is open source and freely available. In this paper, we introduce the framework, provide examples of its use, and discuss its application to research and understanding of the Smart Grid.
