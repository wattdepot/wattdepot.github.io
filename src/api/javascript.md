# Javascript API

The Javascript language binding for manipulating WattDepot servers is still under development.

For a preliminary version used to develop the Admin interface, see [wattdepot-admin.js](https://github.com/wattdepot/wattdepot/blob/master/src/main/resources/dist/js/wattdepot-admin.js).

A more fully featured Javascript language binding for WattDepot 2.0 is available [here](https://code.google.com/p/wattdepot-javascript-client/).  This will hopefully be ported to WattDepot 3.0 in the near future.
