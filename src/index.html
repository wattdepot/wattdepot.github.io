        <h3><strong>OPQBox: Low cost, open source hardware</strong></h3>

        <p>Our first generation OPQBox costs less than US$75, and the schematics are published under an open source hardware license if you want to build it yourself.
        </p>

        <p>We want to create and support an ecosystem of hardware developers that accelerate the development of new designs to satisfy different needs.
          </p>
        <p>Our first generation design is based upon a Raspberry PI.  Our second generation OPQBox will decrease the cost and size, and increase the functionality. Come help us invent the future of power quality monitoring!</p>

        <h3><strong>OPQHub: Cloud-based, open source software service</strong></h3>

        <p>
         Each OPQBox sends power quality events and data to OPQHub, an open source cloud-based service.</p>
        <p>For consumers, this means that you can easily determine if a power quality problem is local to your own house or is more widespread in your neighborhood or city.</p>
        <p>For organizations, this means you can deploy OPQBoxes throughout your facility, and install an OPQHub if you want to keep your power quality information private.</p>
        <p>An OPQHub installed can be installed and run locally, or deployed to a hosting environment such as <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees</a> or <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a></p>
        <p>We also maintain a <a href="http://emilia.ics.hawaii.edu:8194/">public OPQHub</a> for testing and evaluation.</p>

        <h3><strong>OPQ Data: Open source analytics for the smart grid</strong></h3>

        <p>
         Uploading the raw data is only the start. The real power of the OPQ ecosystem is the kinds of analytics it makes possible.
        </p>
        <p>First, each OPQBox is associated with an owner-supplied location.  To support privacy, owners can "coarsen" their OPQBox's location information up to 1 square mile. Coarsened location data still enables the service to provide useful community statistics without revealing the precise individual location of individual OPQBoxes. </p>
        <p>Second, the community nature of OPQ data makes it trivial to determine if a power quality event is local to you or more widespread on the grid.</p>
        <p>Third, correlation of power quality data with other forms of information can provide valuable insight into the impact of renewable energy.  For example, are power quality events more common in areas with high concentration of rooftop solar?  Do power quality events correlate with weather data---for example, a rapidly moving cloud cover?</p>
        <p>The OPQHub architecture is designed to support "plugin" analytics. Have an idea for a new analytic? Let us know!</p>
