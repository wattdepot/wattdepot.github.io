We are beginning development of a brand new implementation of WattDepot, called Version 3.   This version will build upon our experiences using WattDepot.  Major goals for Version 3.0 include better support for cloud hosting, an enhanced domain model, better support for multiple organizations, better security and access control, and improved performance. 

These news items reflect only WattDepot 3 development. For older news concerning WattDepot, see the [WattDepot Users newsgroup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wattdepot-users).
